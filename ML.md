# what I expect to learn in the summer course
In this summer school, I would expected to learn a new programming language called R.  
Also, I hope I can learn what big data is in the summer vacation, and the specific application of big data in reality  
I hope I can also learn what machine learning is and how to implement it in programming with code  

# day1
Today I met other people at summer school  
I learned some basic knowledge about R  
Some R programming statements  
And some basic knowledge about machine learning and big data  

# day2
Today I learned how to use R to create a model  
And how to use this model to analyze data, such as pi
